## 🚢 Beecrowd: one day, one programmation file
I created this repository with the intention of programming every day in C, Java, Python and SQL consults using the beecrowd's exercises.

### 👾 "How do I analise this?" 
You can use the <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/" > Online GDB!</a> for testing the exercises.
They already have the statement of the exercise before the code.
<ul>
  <li> Careful: in Java, you can change the name for "Main" when you compile the code on Online GDB.</li>
</ul>

### 🤔 "Why did you develop this?" 
Because I wanted to try to do an exercise per day and pratice my programmation skills.

### 👩‍💻 "Are you the unic author?" 
Yes, I do all alone.

### 🍀 THANK YOU!
