## 🚢 Beecrowd: one day, one programmation file
I created this repository with the intention of practicing in C, Java, Python and SQL consults using the <a href = "https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/login">beecrowd</a>'s exercises, at least, 3 exercises a week.

### 👾 "How do I analise this?" 
You can use the <a href="https://www.onlinegdb.com/" > Online GDB!</a> for testing the exercises if you prefer to.
<ul>
  <li> Each exercise already have the statement before the code;</li>
  <li> It's just you copy the code here (Ctrl A + Ctrl C) and paste on the Online GDB with the right language selected;</li>
  <li> Careful: in Java, you can change the name for "Main" when you compile the code on Online GDB.</li>
</ul>

But, you can go on my beecrowd's profile: <a href = "https://www.beecrowd.com.br/judge/en/profile/723855"> maria.fer.l.b</a> and see the exercises that I already solved. 
<ul>
  <li> It's not ALL the exercises that I will put here. Some of them I did in a long time ago (those on my profile);</li>
  <li> So, the exercises here are the same that I started to solve since July 2023 - when I was thinking about this repository.</li>
</ul>

### 🤔 "Why are you doing this?" 
Because I wanted to try to do an exercise per day and pratice my programmation skills.

### 👩‍💻 "Are you the unic author?" 
Yes, I do all alone.

### 🍀 THANK YOU!
